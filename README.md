# Carla Object Detection 🚗👁️

CARLA is an open-world simulator widely used for developing and testing autonomous driving systems.  
This project integrates **YOLOv4** with the **CARLA Simulator** to perform **real-time object detection** while driving a simulated vehicle. The detected objects can later be used for dataset generation and training self-driving models.
